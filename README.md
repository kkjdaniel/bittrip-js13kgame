# BitTrip (Js13kGame 2018) 🎮
BitTrip is a tiny endless runner style game written in JavaScript for the 2018 [Js13kGame Competition](https://2018.js13kgames.com). The objective is simple. Keep your bit online for as long as possible, ducking and diving through the hazardous net! Simply use your up and down arrow keys to keep online.

It's tiny too, relying only on canvas drawn elements and vanilla JavaScript, the entire game comes in at **under 2kb zipped!**
